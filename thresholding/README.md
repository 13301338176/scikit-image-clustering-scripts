# Thresholding
Estimate the threshold on a satellite image using the following methods:

1. **otsu_thresholding.py:** Otsu thresholding [Otsu 1979].  
2. **kittler_thresholding.py:** Minimum-error thresholding
[Kittler and Illingworth 1986].  
3. **sb_thresholding:** Split-based thresholding using the previous two
thresholding methods ([Otsu 1979], [Kittler and Illingworth 1986]).
